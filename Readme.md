# Device2
---

## Overview

This is a client-server system for accessing devices and programs in
experimental setups. Previous version was a tcl library (
https://github.com/slazav/tcl-device ) with a few annoying limitations.

There is a server which work with "devices". They can be physical devices
connected in varous ways or programs with special interface. Each device
has a unique name, which is listed in the server configuration file.
Server knowns how to open a device, send it a message and recieve answer.

Clients can connect to the server using HTTP protocol and send messages to
devices. This architecture has many advantages comparing to direct connections
between clients and devices:

* Clients know nothing about device connection details, they should use
only device name to access it. All low-level connection parameters (e.g.
serial port configuration) are managed by the server.

* Multiple clients can access a single device without collisions. All
needed lockings are done by the server. A client can also lock a device for
single use, preventing others from accessing it.

* A device is opened on demand, then the fist client start using it and closed
then all users disconnected. Client should keep a permanent connection
to the server if it wants to use a device without closing/opening it.

* Any client can monitor all messages for any device.

* Remote access to devices can be easiy implemented in this system by
either making a tunnel for HTTP connections, or by attaching the
remote client program, `device_c` to the local server as a device.


## Server

### HTTP communication with the server

Clients communicate with the server using GET requests of HTTP protocol.
URLs with up to three components are used:
`<action>/<device>/<message>`. For example, a request to
`http://<server>:<port>/ask/generator/FREQ?`" sends phrase `FREQ?` to the
device `generator` and returns answer.

TODO: ban `/` character in the device name, or transfer messages via
URL arguments.

On success a response with code 200 and answer of the device in the
message body is returned. On error a response with code 400 is returned.
Error description is written in `Error` header and in the message body.

The server does not know what it sends to a device and what answer is
expected, it just provides connection. For the next layer see DeviceRole
library. It defines certain "roles" for devices with common high-level
commands (e.g. "generator" role has a "set frequency" command).

Supported actions:

* `devices` or `list` -- Show list of all known devices.

* `info/<device>` -- Print information about a device.

* `ask/<device>/<message>` -- Send message to a device, return answer.

* `use/<device>` -- Use a device in this connection. Usually a device is
opened (if it is not opened yet) on demand, then `ask` action is called.
This action can be used to open and check the device before sending any
message to it (e.g. to process errors separately).

* `release/<device>` -- Notify the server that this device is not going
to be used by this connection anymore. Device is closed if no other
connections use it.Normally devices are closed
when session is ended and no other sessions are using the device.

* `lock/<device>` -- Lock the device for single use. Normally no locking
is needed, many clients can communicate with the device without collisions.
But in some cases one may want to lock the device to prevent others from
using it. This is done by the `lock` action, only if
the device has no other users.

* `unlock/<device>` -- Unlock the device previously locked with the `lock`
command. Devices are unlocked when the connection is closed, but the
server keeps the connection longer then it's needed (until new connection
appears). This can cause a problem if you lock the device, reopen the
connection, and try to use the same device. Thus it is recommended to
unlocked device when you finish with it. Command returns errors if device
is locked by somebody else, or if it is not locked.

* `log_start/<device>` -- Any user can see all communications of every device.
To do it one should start with `log_start` action. The buffer of size
1024 lines is created for this connection, all messages send to the
device, all answers and errors recieved will be written to the buffer
(with "<<", ">>", and "EE" prefixes). If the buffer already exists it will
be cleared.

* `log_finish/<device>` -- Stop logging, delete the log buffer for this
connection.

* `log_get/<device>` -- Get contents of the log buffer, clear it. If logging
is stopped return error.

* `ping` -- Check connection to the server. Returns nothing.

* `get_time` -- Get sysem time (unix seconds with microsecond precision)


### Starting the server

Usage:
* `device_d <options>`

Options:

* `-C, --cfgfile <arg>`  -- Server configuration file (default: `/etc/device/device_d.cfg`).
* `-D, --devfile <arg>`  -- Device list file (default: `/etc/device/devices.cfg`).
* `-p, --port <arg>`    -- TCP port for connections (default: `8082`).
* `-f, --dofork`        -- Do fork and run as a daemon.
* `-S, --stop`          -- Stop running daemon (found by pid-file).
* `-v, --verbose <arg>` -- Verbosity level (default: 1):
  - 0 - write nothing;
  - 1 - write some information on server start/stop;
  - 2 - write about opening/closing connections and devices;
  - 3 - write all messages sent to devices and recieved from them.
* `-l, --logfile <arg>` -- Log file, "-" for stdout.
  (default: `/var/log/device_d.log` in daemon mode, "-" in console mode.
* `-P, --pidfile <arg>` -- Pid file (default: `/var/run/device_d.pid`)
* `-h, --help`          -- Print help message and exit.
* `--pod`               -- Print help message in POD format and exit.

Server configuration file can be used to override default values for some
of the command-line options. Following parameters can be set in the
configuration file: `port`, `logfile`, `pidfile`, `devfile`, `verbose`

The file contains one line per device. Empty lines and comments (starting
with `#`) are allowed. A few lines can be joined by adding symbol `\`
before end of line. Words can be quoted by single or double quotes.
Special symbols (`#`, `\`, quotes) can be typed by adding `\` in front of
them. Case of characters is important. Each non-empty, non-comment line
should have the form:
```
<parameter name> <parameter value>
```


### Device list file

Default location of the device configuration file is
`/etc/device2/devices.cfg` It can be changed by with server command-line
option `-D` or in the server onfiguration file.

The file contains one line per device. Empty lines and comments (starting
with `#`) are allowed. A few lines can be joined by adding symbol `\`
before end of line. Words can be quoted by single or double quotes.
Special symbols (`#`, `\`, quotes) can be typed by adding `\` in front of
them. Case of characters is important. Each non-empty, non-comment line
should have the form:
```
<device name> <driver name> [-<parameter> <value> ...]
```
Parameters are driver-specific.

### Driver `serial` -- Serial devices

This is a very general driver with lots of parameters (see source code)
Other serial drivers are based on it. As an example, configuration of
Pfeiffer ASM340 leak detecter can be written as

asm340a  serial \
  -dev /dev/ttyUSB0 -speed 9600 -parity 8N1 -cread 1 -clocal 1\
  -timeout 2.0 -vmin 0 -ndelay 0 -icrnl 0\
  -sfc 1 -raw 1 -errpref "ASM340: " -delay 0\
  -ack_str \x06 -nack_str \x15 -add_str \r -trim_str \r
```

but there is a special driver which set all needed parameters:
```
asm340b  serial_asm340 -dev /dev/ttyUSB0
```

## Client

Program `device_c` is a command-line client for working with the server.

Usage:
* `device_c [<options>] ask <dev> <msg>` -- send message to the device, print answer
* `device_c [<options>] use_dev <dev>`   -- SPP interface to a device
* `device_c [<options>] use_srv`         -- SPP interface to the server
* `device_c [<options>] (list|devices)`  -- print list of available devices
* `device_c [<options>] info <dev>`      -- print information about device
* `device_c [<options>] log <dev>`       -- log all communication of the device
* `device_c [<options>] ping`            -- check if the server is working
* `device_c [<options>] get_time`        -- get server system time

Options:
* `-s, --server <arg>` -- Server (default: http://localhost:8082).
* `-l, --lock`         -- Lock the device (only for `use_dev` action).
* `-h, --help`         -- Print help message and exit.
* `--pod`              -- Print help message in POD format and exit.

Client configuration file (`/etc/device/device_d.cfg`) is similar to the
server one. The only parameter which can be set in the file is `server`.

### Examples

Get device list. There are two devices available:
```
$ device_c list
graphene
test
```

Get information about a device. The device uses `spp` driver which runs program `graphene -i`
and talks with it using SPP interface. It is not used by anybody (and thus closed).
```
$ device_c info graphene
Device: graphene
Driver: spp
Driver arguments:
  -prog: graphene -i
Device is closed
Number of users: 0
```

Send message to a device and get answer. In this case we send `get_time` command to
the `graphene` program:
```
$ device_c ask graphene get_time
1601282446.214037
```

The server also has `get_time` action to get system time on the server:
```
$ device_c get_time
1601284005.581721
```

Use a device for multiple queries, without reopening it. In this case SPP protocol
is used: each message is followed by `#OK` or `#Error <message>` line.
Every input line is sent to the device as-is, answer is returned.

```
$ device_c use_dev graphene
#SPP001
Server: http://localhost:8082
Device: graphene
#OK
bad_command
#Error: Unknown command: bad_command
get_time 0
#Error: too many parameters
get_time
1601284282.200903
#OK
```

Use the server for multiple queries. In this mode you have access to all
server actions and can work with multiple devices. Every input line is
split into three words: `action`, `device`, and `message`. The
`read_word` library ( https://github.com/slazav/mapsoft2-libs/tree/master/read_words ) is used
to enable quotes, escape characters, multiline input etc. For example, if
you want to use spaces in the message, quote it.

```
$ device_c use_srv
#SPP001
Server: http://localhost:8082
#OK
ask graphene get_time
1601284389.596303
#OK
list
graphene
test

#OK
info graphene
Device: graphene
Driver: spp
Driver arguments:
  -prog: graphene -i
Device is open
Number of users: 1
You are currently using the device

#OK
```
